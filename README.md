Machine Learning Mini Project and Final Project

# Introduction

---

In August 23rd 2000 Enron stock hit a record high of $90 a share. 16 months later, on December 2nd 2001, the company declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy with the loss of over 4000 jobs[2]. 
This classic case of corperate fraud is used as the basis Project 5 in the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Intro to Machine learning.

The purpose of the porject is to identify persons of interest (POI's) within the Enron email corpus (May 7th 2015 version used [2]) combined with publicly avialable pay and share data.

Using a prepared dataset of 145 manually identified POI/non-POI's a machine learning classifier has been created in Python using the numpy and scikit learn packages.

The main file for this project located in this repositry is poi_id.py  located in the final_project directory, this is the completed version of the classifier. 
Multiple steps in the learning process and alternative classifiers have been saved in the format poi_id_X.py to record attempted classifiers and to save for comparison.
